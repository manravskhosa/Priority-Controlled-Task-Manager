# priorityQueue
This project is an implementation of a priority queue using AvlTree and BinaryHeap classes, with custom avNode and bhNode data types for efficient storage and organization. The avNode stores Task-ID and index of the information in BinaryHeap, while bhNode stores priority value and a pointer to avNode for easy access and updates to Task-ID.
